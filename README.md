# SHI WU CHINESE DRINKING GAME (0-5-10-15-20):

This is a traditional Chinese Drinking game where the loser has to drink!

But I think we can skip the drinking and just keep score to be safe.

## RULES & HOW TO PLAY:
The outcome of each round can be 0, 5, 10, 15 or 20.

Each of the two players at the same time decides either to keep their hands closed,
 or open 1 hand or two.

The sum of all the figures opened up is the outcome.

Each player tries to guess the outcome before the hand opens.

If one player is able to guess correctly (exclusively) they win the round - otherwise it's a tie.

Here is an example of how it would be played in real life: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/JqGABVdmS6g

In this game you will play against the CPU.

**STEP 1:** Pick a target of what you guess the outcome to be.

**STEP 2:** You then have 3 seconds to decide how many hands to show

**STEP 3:** The result for the round will be shown

**REPEAT Steps 1-3 until you or the CPU gets too drunk on all the fun.**

GOOD LUCK!
